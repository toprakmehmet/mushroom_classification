## Goal
Build best fit machine learning models to predict that mushroom is edible or not

## Data Source
The dataset was downloaded from https://data.world/uci/mushroom/workspace/project-summary?agentid=uci&datasetid=mushroom as csv file

## Python Tools:
   - Pandas
   - Sklearn
   - Seaborn/Matplotlib
   - SciPy/NumPy

## Statitstical Tests Used
In order to determine a bestfit model, the following 9 were tested. As you can see below Bagged Tree was the most effective
