## Description

This predictive model can classify Mushrooms types(edible or not) based on mushrooms appearance!
 - The dataset was downloaded from https://data.world/uci/mushroom/workspace/project-summary?agentid=uci&datasetid=mushroom as csv file
 - Gathered 23 features on 5k mushrooms
 - Engineered features from raw data that ended up being the most influential on model accuracy
 - Compared evaluation metrics of 9 models to find top performer; Bagged Tree was most effective


## Python Tools:
   - Pandas
   - Sklearn
   - Seaborn/Matplotlib
   - SciPy/NumPy

## Statitstical Tests Used
In order to determine a bestfit model, the following 9 were tested. As you can see below Bagged Tree was the most effective
